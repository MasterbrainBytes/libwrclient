libwrclient itself (everything in src/) is released under MIT license.
libwrclient includes the source code of (and links statically) libogg,
libvorbis and libmpg123 (in libsrc/), which have their own licenses.

Notably, libmpg123 is released under LGPL v2.1, which effectively puts
the libwrclient binary under LGPL if compiled with MP3 support!
On some platforms (like closed gaming consoles and probably Apple's iOS)
you're not allowed to use LGPL software, so you can't use libwrclient
with MP3 support there. You can disable MP3 support by commenting out
"#define WRC_MP3 1" in src/internal.h and then not linking libmpg123.
Note that LGPL also forbids static linking into software that's
not open source - dynamic linking however (using as .dll/.so) is ok.
